## Beta Unleashed v2.0

**By: danygames2014, no_mic_, and Telvarost**

Other Contributors: Mongster, all the developers of mods used, all texture pack/shader artists, and all play-testers.

The Ultimate Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 Instance using Java 17 and Babric. Keeping the gameplay as vanilla as possible (and making any non-vanilla features toggleable), while fixing major bugs, boosting performance, removing/modifying annoying features, and adding many QoL features.

## Some Notes:

SmoothBeta does not work in MacOS.
- If your game is crashing shortly after playing in a world try disabling SmoothBeta as it has been known to cause issues on some machines that are not MacOS. If possible it is better to include it though as the machines it does work on performance is greatly improved.


Make sure you are using Java 17. You can download from https://adoptium.net/ or https://www.azul.com/downloads/ , or use https://prismlauncher.org/ which has a built-in Java detector and downloader.

SmoothBeta and Macula are incompatible, so turn one off when using the other one. It is also recommended to turn off Advanced OpenGL to prevent lighting issues while using Macula/shaders.


Converting from 1.x/vanilla into 2.x is done automatically when loading the world for the first time in 2.0, no extra steps needed. While this process is considered safe, it is recommended to make a world backup beforehand.

Only one step is needed to convert a world from 2.x to 1.x/vanilla. Select the world you want to convert in the Select World menu, press “Edit” then “Convert to McRegion”. After countdown and final confirmation, you can go to the .minecraft/saves folder and move the world file (not the zip file that was created) anywhere you want. Again, while this process is considered safe, it is recommended to make a world backup beforehand.
