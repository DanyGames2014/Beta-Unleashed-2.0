notes="\nBeta Unleashed v2.0\n\nBy: danygames2014, no_mic_, and Telvarost\n\nOther Contributors: Mongster, all the developers of all mods used, and all texture pack/shaders artists.\n\nA HUGE thank you to all play-testers.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Ultimate Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 Instance using Java 17 and Babric. Keeping the gameplay as vanilla as possible (and making any non-vanilla features toggleable), while fixing major bugs, boosting performance, removing/modifying annoying features, and adding many QOL features.\n\nBeta Unleashed Discord Server: https://discord.gg/q3aWwxB2zf\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeta Unleashed v2.0 Changelog:\n\n(Add Video Link)\n\n\nAdds BetterScreenshots, which adds isometric and custom resolution screenshots to the game. This mod also lets you change the angle and direction the isometric screenshot is taken at, and if in the nether, whether the bedrock ceiling is rendered. Unlike the 1.1 isometric screenshot, the image is not flipped by default. Basic screenshots are automatically added to your clipboard.\n\nAdds BHCreative, which adds a more “release accurate” Creative mode to the world creation options. BHCreative mode gives you the ability to fly, have infinite blocks, break blocks instantly, and grants you invincibility. The Creative item selection screen also includes any custom items added in by mods like The Aether (press the little arrow in the GUI).\n\nAdds CreativeEditorWands, which adds world edit type properties to wooden tools when enabled. Check out its GitHub/Modrinth page to learn how to use it.\n\nAdds Freecam: X to toggle, V to toggle player movement, B to change Freecam speed, Control + N or M to save and load camera positions.\n\nAdds Gambáč, which fixes several crashes and bugs that happen when trying to use Babric on a MacOS computer (including the inverted colors bug).\n\nAdds Glass Config API, which lets you edit the configurations of mods in-game.\n\nAdds HowManyItems (Fabric Port), an inventory editor and recipe viewer mod.\n\nAdds HudTweaks, which adds the ability to customize your hotbar position, disable the crosshair and scroll through chat messages. Also adds the ability to disable, randomize, or show player coordinates in debug overlay. (default: Show)\n\nAdds InventoryTweaks, which adds drag-clicking and moving hotbar items with number keys, among other things like features from the MouseTweaks mod.\n\nAdds LegacyTranslations, which adds custom language loading capabilities, not like Mojang's modern Minecraft static language list, but with a custom language system much the same as texture packs.\n\nAdds Macula, which adds shaders support. Incompatible with SmoothBeta, and incompatible with most modern shaders. Shaders that do work are already added in for user’s convenience. It is also recommended to turn off Advanced OpenGL to prevent lighting issues.\n\nAdds MiscTweaks, which adds these togglable features:\n- Craftable double “smooth” stone slabs\n- Chests opening when there is a block above\n- Coloring sign text with dye\n- Editing sign text with feather\n- Sticks drop from dead bushes\n- Shears collect dead bushes\n- Shears collect tall grass\n- Defuse TNT with shears\n- Apples drop from oak leaves\n- Disabling Creeper, Ghast, and TNT explosions from breaking blocks\n- Disabling Ghast explosions from creating fire\n- Disable trampling farmland (can also do that wearing boots tramples farmland, and can make leather boots the exception)\n- Equalizing base armor durability (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, and Boots will all have the same durability)\n- Modern armor defense points (Lower tiers have less defense and defense does not decrease with durability loss)\n- Select different zombie drops (feathers, red mushrooms, cyan dye, green dye, clay, paper, or nothing)\n\nAdds Mod Menu (Beta Port), which adds a mod menu.\n\nAdds MojangFixStationAPI, which:\n- Makes client send auth signal, and lets any servers joined to verify\n- Fixes the bit depth bug\n- Adds the ability to resend previous messages with arrow keys, and ability to copy+paste into chat\n- Fixes tab autocomplete when using SPC (press tab twice)\n- Fixes the death screen score\n- Some changes to the F3 debug graph, can now be displayed by pressing F3+LControl\n- Shows world seed in F3\n- Adds Multiplayer Server list\n- Adds the Quit button (UniTweaks also adds this)\n- Adds a SkinFix\n- Adds ability to copy+paste text onto signs\n- Adds compatibility to slim skins\n- Adds ability to hide server list IP addresses\n\nAdds Player List, which adds a Tab player list ONLY if the server has a /list command.\n\nAdds Single Player Commands (Fabric Port), do /help to learn more.\n\nAdds SmoothBeta, which significantly optimizes the terrain/block rendering, and entity spawning/rendering. Incompatible with Macula (the shaders mod) and does not work on MacOS.\n\nAdds StAPI No Annoying Intro, which removes the StationAPI loading screen from the game launch intro and texture pack loading.\n\nAdds Station API, “A general use API for Fabric Loader mods on legacy Minecraft versions.”\n\nAdds Third Person Fix, which adds the ability to see your skin’s face by double clicking F5.\n\nAdds UniTweaks, which adds these togglable features:\n- Zoom\n- FOV slider\n- Customizable fog density\n- Customizable cloud height\n- Customizable render distance (goes up to 32 chunks)\n- Fog Key (F) still works, changing the render distance\n- Customizable FPS limit\n- Customizable version text\n- Packet Speedup Patch\n- Text field clearing with RMB\n- Improved Controls Menu, which now lets you rebind all keys, including hotbar number keys and Function keys\n- Brightness Slider (Not Gamma)\n- Quit button (UniTweaks also adds this)\n- Bit Depth Fix\n- Slime Split Fix\n- Stairs Drop Fix\n- Boat Dismount Fix\n- Block Effectiveness Fix\n- Pig Drop Saddle Fix\n- Multiplayer Entity Physics Fix\n- Fence Bounding Box Fix\n- Pick Block Fix\n- Spring Propagation Fix\n- Lava Without Source Fix\n- Bow Held Fix\n- Leggings Riding Fix\n- Video Settings Slider Fix\n- Fullscreen Cursor Fix\n- Furnace Consume Bucket Fix\n- Fish Velocity Fix\n- Main Menu Panorama (default included: beta18 and glacier)\n- Ability to disable F3 Entity ID Tags\n- Hide achievement “toast” (the box that appears when you get an achievement)\n- “Better Burning”, which changes the way mobs that are on fire work\n- “Fast Leaf Decay”, which lets you customize the rate at which leafs decay\n- Directly igniting entities with flint and steel\n- Placing sugar cane on sand\n- Floating trapdoors\n- Shears collect cobwebs and tall grass\n- Faster boat and faster handling\n- Boats drop themselves when broken\n- Bookshelves drop 3 books\n- Disable sleeping, but retain respawning\n- Disable spawning mobs when you sleep (removes the nightmare bug)\n- Disable flint and steel being damaged on fail ignite\n- Bigger chicken hitbox (modern size)\n- Fences connect to blocks\n- Modern fence placement\n- More sounds (tool breaking, sheep shearing, eating)\n- Pressure plates placeable on fences\n- Dropped items can’t stop minecarts\n- Many configurable crafting recipes (6 slabs crafted, can books require leather, 1 stone for button)\n- Allow repairing tools in crafting grid\n- More wooden items are burnable\n- Can enable boat elevators\n- Can disable dead bush and tall grass from generating\n- Can hoe grass for seeds\n- Minecart boosters\n- Punch sheep for wool\n- Punch TNT to ignite\n- Equip armor with right click\n- No food wastage (can not eat when at full health)\n- Shift placing\n- Step assist\n\nAdds in some texture packs (All credit to the artists, updated LegacyPack, again)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome Notes:\n\nMake sure you are using Java 17.\n\nYou will need to complete some steps to convert a world from 2.x to 1.x or a vanilla instance. Select the world that you want to convert, press “Edit” then “Convert to McRegion”. After the countdown and final confirmation, you can go to the .minecraft > saves folder and move the world file (not the zip file that was created). Converting from 1.x or vanilla into 2.x is done automatically when loading the world for the first time, no extra steps.\n\nMacOS computers can not run SmoothBeta.\n\nSmoothBeta and Macula (shaders mod) are incompatible. It is also recommended to turn off Advanced OpenGL to prevent lighting issues while using shaders.\n\nMost mods will work while on a server. The mods that might have issues are:\n- BHCreative is a Singleplayer mod only\n- CreativeEditorWands (server would need GlassConfigAPI)\n- HowManyItems cheat version does not work on servers (without OP)\n- InventoryTweaks has no scroll wheel tweaks and simplified click drag actions while in a server\n- MiscTweaks (some features are server side, such as “Coloring sign text with dye”)\n- Player List requires that the server has a /list command\n- UniTweaks (some features are server side, such as “Placing sugar cane on sand”)\n\nFeatures missing from 2.0 that are in 1.1:\n- LAN play\n- Some OptiFine video settings \n- Toggle sneak\n- Light level, biome, day count, and game time info in the F3 debug screen\n- Some SinglePlayerCommands commands\n- Fixed player shadow when standing next to a 2 block wall\n- LongDistancePatch (Farlands jitter)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNone of these mods are mine, so here is a shout out to the mod creators:\n\nBabric - js6pak, CatCore, calmilamsy\nBetterScreenshots - Telvarost (shoutout to Birevan and Exalm for their help)\nBHCreative - paulevs\nCreativeEditorWands - Telvarost \nFreecam - Ralf2oo2\nGambáč - DanyGames2014\nGlass Config API - calmilamsy, Zekromaster, mineLdiver, Cat Core\nHowManyItems (Fabric Port) - calmilamsy, Rek (another shoutout to Rek for the original mod)\nHudTweaks - Telvarost (shoutout to cen0b for suggestions)\nInventoryTweaks - Telvarost (shoutout to YaLTeR and js6pak for inspiration)\nLegacyTranslations - Telvarost, Vivian, Birevan, Roadhog360, icanttellyou\nMacula - daxnitro, mine_diver\nMiscTweaks - Telvarost, 2zqa\nMod Menu (Beta Port) - calmilamsy, Telvarost (shoutout to Prospector + 71 Contributors for original mod)\nMojangFixStationAPI - Telvarost, js6pak\nPlayer List - Vic is a Cat\nSingle Player Commands (Fabric Port) - slainlight (shoutout to imo_415 for original mod)\nSmoothBeta - mine_diver\nStAPI No Annoying Intro - Vic is a Cat\nStation API - mineLdiver, calmilamsy, paulevs and 6 other Contributors\nThird Person Fix - Slainlight\nUniTweaks - DanyGames2014, Telvarost\n"
