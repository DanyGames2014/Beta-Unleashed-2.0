notes="\nBeta Unleashed v2.0\n\nBy: danygames2014, no_mic_, and Telvarost\n\nOther Contributors: Mongster, all the developers of all mods used, all texture pack/shader artists, and all play-testers.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Ultimate Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 Instance using Java 17 and Babric. Keeping the gameplay as vanilla as possible (and making any non-vanilla features toggleable), while fixing major bugs, boosting performance, removing/modifying annoying features, and adding many QoL features.\n\nBeta Unleashed Discord Server: https://discord.gg/q3aWwxB2zf\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeta Unleashed v2.0 Changelog:\n\n(Add Video Link Here)\n\nAdds Always More Items, an inventory editor and recipe viewer mod. Includes a rarities system, set day/night and heal buttons.\n\nAdds BetaLAN, which allows for easily launching a server using the currently loaded single-player world (like starting a LAN world) and currently in use mod-set/configuration. Backup world zip file is created on server launch (if the config setting is turned on). You will need to port forward and use public IP to let others join the server, or use a program like LogMeInHamachi or ZeroTier to “fake” a LAN connection.\n\nAdds BetterScreenshots, which adds isometric and custom resolution screenshots to the game. This mod also lets you change the angle, direction, and zoom the isometric screenshot is taken at, and if in the nether, whether the bedrock ceiling is rendered. Basic screenshots are automatically added to your clipboard.\n\nAdds BHCreative, which adds a more “release accurate” Creative mode to the world creation options. BHCreative mode gives you the ability to fly, have infinite blocks, break blocks instantly, and grants you invincibility. The Creative item selection screen also includes any custom items added in by mods like The Aether (press the little arrow in the GUI).\n\nAdds CreativeEditorWands, which adds WorldEdit type properties to wooden tools when enabled, as well as a very basic structure command. Check out its GitHub/Modrinth page to learn how to use it.\n\nAdds Freecam: X to toggle, V to toggle player movement, B to change Freecam speed, Control + N or M to save and load camera positions. Freecam can not phase through surfaces as to not provide an unfair advantage on multiplayer servers.\n\nAdds Gambac, which:\n- Fixes inverted colors on Apple silicon M chips\n- Fixes “Missing LWJGL2 Natives” crash on MacOS\n- deAWTs the game and makes Minecraft directly use the LWJGL Display\n- Restores the icon and window name after applying the deAWT\n\nAdds Glass Config API 3, which lets you edit the configurations of mods in-game.\n\nAdds Glass Networking, used by Glass Config API to send/receive packets to/from servers.\n\nAdds HudTweaks, which adds the ability to customize hotbar position, disable the crosshair and scroll through chat messages. Also adds ability to disable, randomize, or show player coordinates in debug overlay (default: Show), and toggleable Xbox X and Y controller buttons.\n\nAdds InventoryTweaks, which adds drag-clicking, modern shift click crafting, and moving hotbar items with number keys.\n\nAdds Macula, which adds shaders support. Shaders tested to work are already added in for user’s convenience. It is also recommended to turn off Advanced OpenGL to prevent lighting issues while using Macula.\n\nAdds MiscTweaks, which adds these togglable features:\n- Enable wood log rotation\n- Disable lightning strikes causing fire\n- Chests opening when there is a block above\n- Coloring sign text with dye\n- Editing sign text with feather\n- Sticks drop from dead bushes\n- Shears collect dead bushes\n- Shears collect tall grass\n- Disable leaf decay for player placed leaves\n- Ghast fireballs can insta-kill ghasts\n- Apples drop from oak leaves\n- Shears collect ferns (BHCreative is required for this to work, item will disappear if BHCreative is removed)\n- Defuse TNT with shears\n- Disabling Creeper, Ghast, and TNT explosions from breaking blocks\n- Disabling Ghast explosions from creating fire\n- Disable trampling farmland (can also do that wearing boots tramples farmland, and can make leather boots the exception)\n- Equalizing base armor durability (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, and Boots will all have the same durability)\n- Modern armor defense points (Lower tiers have less defense and defense does not decrease with durability loss)\n- Select different zombie drops (feathers, red mushrooms, cyan dye, green dye, clay, paper, or nothing)\n- Select different zombie pigman drops (cooked pork chops, raw pork chops, brown mushrooms, gold sword, bone meal, brick, or nothing)\n\nAdds Mod Menu (Beta Port), which adds a mod menu to view the list of mods you have installed.\n\nAdds MojangFixStationAPI, which:\n- Directly contacts Mojang's API to fetch skin and cape data\n- Fixes the bit depth bug\n- Adds the ability to resend previous messages with arrow keys, and ability to copy+paste into chat\n- Fixes tab autocomplete when using SPC (press tab twice)\n- Fixes the death screen score\n- Some changes to the F3 debug graph, can now be displayed by pressing F3+LControl\n- Shows world seed in F3\n- Adds Multiplayer Server list\n- Adds the Quit button (UniTweaks also adds this)\n- Adds ability to copy+paste text onto signs\n- Adds compatibility to slim skins\n- Adds ability to hide server list IP addresses\n\nAdds Player List, a client-side mod that adds a player list. Only works if the server has the plugin Essentials or the mod RetroCommands.\n\nAdds QuickAdditions, which adds miscellaneous features such as:\n- Give player missing achievements that they may have already achieved (only works when in world, not main menu)\n- Force display active even when tabbing away from the screen\n- Change background music countdown timer min and max interval values\n- Can add custom background music to the game (add .ogg, .mus, or .wav files to the custom-music file), can disable default Minecraft background music, can add main menu song (add a .ogg, .mus, or .wav file to the main-menu-theme file), and can have main menu song override background music (Vanilla b1.7.3 has Minecraft background music continue to play on main menu if started in-game)\n- Can speed up night rather than skip it when sleeping (entire night last 30 seconds)\n- Can exit beds by clicking or swinging the hand\n- Craftable soul sand\n- Change max mob spawn capacity for different creature types (Monster, passive (animals), and squid max spawn capacity can be changed.)\n- Change mob spawn group size.\n- Set a Y level above which it will always snow\n- Disable weather reset when sleeping and the weather is clear (This makes rain, snow, and thunder more common)\n- Specify which dimension or biome a custom song plays in\n- Configure time and duration for rain and thunder\n- Disable living entity despawning\n- Adjustable volume level through configs for some sounds\n\nAdds Retro Commands, which works on servers, and has no required dependencies. (To access /tp with dimensions, enable STAPI, and to access /gamemode, enable BHCreative).\n\nAdds RetroAuth, which adds authentication and skin fixes, and allows for using modern minecraft skins on servers. \n\nAdds SmoothBeta, which significantly optimizes the terrain/block rendering, and entity spawning/rendering. Incompatible with Macula (the shaders mod) and does not work on MacOS.\n\nAdds StAPI No Annoying Intro, which removes the StationAPI loading screen from the game launch intro and texture pack loading.\n\nAdds Station API, “A general use API for Fabric Loader mods on legacy Minecraft versions.”\n\nAdds Third Person Fix, which adds the ability to see your skin’s face by double clicking F5.\n\nAdds UniTweaks, which adds these togglable features:\n- Added Photo Mode\n- Zoom (scrollable)\n- FOV slider\n- Customizable fog density\n- Customizable cloud height\n- Customizable render distance (goes up to 32 chunks)\n- Fog Key (F) still works, changing the render distance\n- GUI Scale Slider\n- More configurable Video Settings\n- Customizable FPS limit\n- Customizable version text\n- Packet Speedup Patch\n- Mouse Raw Input\n- Text field clearing with RMB\n- Improved Controls Menu, which now lets you rebind all keys, including hotbar number keys and Function keys\n- Brightness Slider (Not Gamma)\n- Quit button (UniTweaks also adds this)\n- Bit Depth Fix\n- Far Lands Jitter Fix\n- TCP NoDelay Fix\n- Death Screen Score Format Fix\n- Breaking Animation Fix\n- Hotbar Rendering Fix\n- Slime Split Fix\n- Stairs Drop Fix\n- Boat Dismount Fix\n- Block Effectiveness Fix\n- Pig Drop Saddle Fix\n- Multiplayer Entity Physics Fix\n- Fence Bounding Box Fix\n- Pick Block Fix\n- Spring Propagation Fix\n- Lava Without Source Fix\n- Bow Held Fix\n- Leggings Riding Fix\n- Video Settings Slider Fix\n- Fullscreen Cursor Fix\n- Furnace Consume Bucket Fix\n- Fish Velocity Fix\n- Main Menu Panorama (default included: beta18 and glacier)\n- Ability to disable F3 Entity ID Tags\n- Hide achievement “toast” (the box that appears when you get an achievement)\n- “Better Burning”, which changes the way mobs that are on fire work\n- “Fast Leaf Decay”, which lets you customize the rate at which leafs decay\n- Directly igniting entities with flint and steel\n- Placing sugar cane on sand\n- Floating trapdoors\n- Shears collect cobwebs and tall grass\n- Faster boat and faster handling\n- Boats drop themselves when broken\n- Bookshelves drop 3 books\n- Disable sleeping, but retain respawning\n- Disable spawning mobs when you sleep (removes the nightmare bug)\n- Disable flint and steel being damaged on fail ignite\n- Bigger chicken hitbox (modern size)\n- Fences connect to blocks\n- Modern fence placement\n- More sounds (tool breaking, sheep shearing, eating)\n- Pressure plates placeable on fences\n- Dropped items can’t stop minecarts\n- Many configurable crafting recipes (6 slabs crafted, can books require leather, 1 stone for button)\n- Allow repairing tools in crafting grid\n- More wooden items are burnable\n- Can enable boat elevators\n- Can disable dead bush and tall grass from generating\n- Can hoe grass for seeds\n- Minecart boosters\n- Punch sheep for wool\n- Punch TNT to ignite\n- Equip armor with right click\n- No food wastage (can not eat when at full health)\n- Shift placing\n- Step assist\n- Change autosave interval\n- Added the ability to disable pausing on lost focus\n- Added a ungrab mouse keybind\n\nAdds UniTweaksTelsAddons, which adds:\n- Modern slab placement (old placement removed when active)\n- New world day counter in place of old stat day counter, and replace real world days with play time hours\n- Ability to use modern stack sizes for signs, wooden doors, and iron doors\n- Vehicle Login/Logout Fix\n- Soul sand is on shovel effective block list\n- Day counter to debug screen (Number in parentheses is real world days)\n- Light level to debug screen (Calculated at player's eye level)\n- Biome to debug screen\n- Slime chunk check to debug overlay\n- Ability to disable different particle types\n- Ability for pigs to drop mushrooms\n- Ability to milk squids\n- Keeps player crafting grid config toggle from BetaTweaks StationAPI\n\nAdds in some texture packs (All credit to the artists).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome Notes:\n\nSmoothBeta does not work in MacOS.\n\nMake sure you are using Java 17. You can download from https://adoptium.net/ or https://www.azul.com/downloads/ , or use https://prismlauncher.org/ which has a built-in Java detector and downloader.\n\nSmoothBeta and Macula are incompatible, so turn one off when using the other one. It is also recommended to turn off Advanced OpenGL to prevent lighting issues while using Macula/shaders.\n\nA one step is needed to convert a world from 2.x to 1.x/vanilla. Select the world you want to convert in the Select World menu, press “Edit” then “Convert to McRegion”. After countdown and final confirmation, you can go to the .minecraft > saves folder and move the world file (not the zip file that was created) anywhere you want. Converting from 1.x/vanilla into 2.x is done automatically when loading the world for the first time, no extra steps needed. While this process is consistently safe, it is recommended to make a world backup for anything you care about.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA shout out to the mod creators:\n\nAlways More Items - calmilamsy, danygames2014\nBabric - js6pak, CatCore, calmilamsy\nBetaLAN - Telvarost, danyGames2014\nBetterScreenshots - Telvarost (shoutout to Birevan and Exalm for their help)\nBHCreative - paulevs\nCreativeEditorWands - Telvarost \nFreecam - Ralf2oo2, Telvarost \nGambáč - DanyGames2014\nGlass Config API - calmilamsy, Zekromaster, mineLdiver, Cat Core\nGlass Networking - calmilamsy\nHudTweaks - Telvarost (shoutout to cen0b for suggestions)\nInventoryTweaks - Telvarost (shoutout to YaLTeR and js6pak for inspiration)\nMacula - daxnitro, mine_diver\nMiscTweaks - Telvarost, 2zqa\nMod Menu (Beta Port) - calmilamsy, Telvarost (shoutout to Prospector + 71 Contributors for original mod)\nMojangFixStationAPI - Telvarost, js6pak\nPlayer List - Vicisacat, Telvarost\nQuickAdditions - Telvarost\nRetro Commands - slainlight (shoutout to imo_415 for original mod (Single PlayerCommands))\nRetroAuth - Slainlight\nSmoothBeta - mine_diver\nStAPI No Annoying Intro - Vicisacat\nStation API - mineLdiver, calmilamsy, paulevs and 6 other Contributors\nThird Person Fix - Slainlight\nUniTweaks - DanyGames2014, Telvarost\nUniTweaksTelsAddons - Telvarost\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLicense:\n\nCopyright © 2025 Beta Unleashed Dev Team\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
